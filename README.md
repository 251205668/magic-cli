## Getting Start

This section will help you learn how to use [Magic-cli](https://github.com/vbs-plus/magic-cli). If you already have an existing project and would like to keep project inside the project, start from Step 2.

###  Step 1: Install Magic

To install the new package, use one of the following commands.

``` sh
$ npm install -g @vbs/magic-cli-core
# OR
$ yarn global add @vbs/magic-cli-core
# OR
$ pnpm install --global @vbs/magic-cli-core
```

If you are using [zi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/za-zi), you can run the following command.

```sh
$ zi -g @vbs/magic-cli-core
```

You can check you have the right version with this command:

```sh
magic --version
```
